# Edge Clamp Connector

Clamp style connector allowing you to join the edges of plywood or other materials together.

This edge clamp connector was inspired by the commercial connectors made by Ply Products (https://www.plyproducts.com) and Playwood (https://www.playwood.it). If you don't want to make your own or are looking to save time; please buy their connectors!

I created this as proof of concept and it certainly needed a bit more refinement, and that's where you come in! Please use, make, modify and submit your changes and feedback for all to benefit from!

This connector was designed for creating a 90-degree joint between 1/2" (12.7 mm) to 3/4" (19 mm) stock (plywood, OSB, lumber, etc.). I used a 1-1/4" #8-32 machine screw and nut (it's what I had on hand); you will need a longer nut for 3/4" stock.
